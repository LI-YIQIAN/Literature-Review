                    <li>Captions Within Multimedia Learning and Working Memory Theories</li>
                    <p>According to the <em>Multimedia Leanring Theory</em> (based on the multimedia principle):leanring will become deeper and longer lasting when there're both aural and visual input. The WM contains four components: 
                        Central executive.
                        Phonological loop.
                        Visuo-spatial working memory.
                        Episodic buffer. 
                        and each one is responsible for specific functions. </p>
                    <a href="WM.png"><img src="WM.png"></a>
                    <p>The things people learned first come into temporary memory stores, the <em>PHONOLOGICAL LOOP</em> that is responsible for encoding the sound, and <em>VISUO-SPATIAL Working MEMORY</em> which encodes visual and patial information. 
                        The <em>CENTRAL EXECUTIVE</em> is for higher cognitive functions like contrast and compare, that all the informations are gathered together into <em>EPISODIC BUFFER</em>, where the mental representation occurs so that short-term memories become more permanently stored and even into long-time memories. </p>
                    <table>
